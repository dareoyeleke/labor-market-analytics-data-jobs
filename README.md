SQL Engineering — Analytics Data Modeling & Metrics
Overview

This repository contains a collection of SQL engineering scripts designed to transform raw job posting data into analytics-ready tables and derived metrics.

The focus of this project is SQL craftsmanship:

data modeling

transformation logic

aggregation correctness

temporal analysis

segmentation and metric design

Any BI assets included in the repository are downstream consumers of the SQL layer and are not the primary artifact.

Core SQL Skills Demonstrated
Data Modeling & Transformation

Staging raw data into clean, queryable structures

Designing dimension and fact tables with controlled grain

Normalizing inconsistent fields (roles, locations, compensation)

Managing one-to-many and many-to-many relationships

Aggregation & Metric Engineering

Building salary and compensation metrics using explicit aggregation logic

Preventing double counting through grain-aware grouping

Conditional aggregation for segmented analysis (e.g. role, location, remote status)

Use of median, average, and distribution-based measures

Window Functions

Ranking and percentile calculations for compensation analysis

Salary distribution analysis using analytic functions

Comparative metrics within partitions (by role, location, seniority)

Date & Time Analysis

Parsing and standardizing date fields

Time-based aggregation (monthly / yearly groupings)

Temporal trend analysis of job postings and compensation

Handling incomplete or inconsistent date data

Segmentation Logic

Role-based and seniority-based segmentation

Remote vs on-site classification

Skill-based grouping and comparison

Geographic segmentation for location analysis

Data Quality & Assumptions

Explicit handling of missing or invalid salary values

Conversion of hourly compensation to annualized figures using stated assumptions

Filtering outliers that materially distort aggregates

Deduplication at the defined fact grain

Primary artifact: /sql
All analytical outputs are derived entirely from this layer.

SQL Characteristics

Modular, readable scripts using CTE-based pipelines

ANSI-style SQL (portable across modern warehouses)

Queries written with correctness, clarity, and debuggability in mind

Explicit assumptions documented in logic rather than implied

Intended Use

This repository is intended to demonstrate SQL engineering and analytical reasoning, not visualization design or narrative reporting.

The scripts are suitable for:

analytics engineering roles

data analyst roles with strong SQL expectations

technical interviews and SQL walkthroughs

Notes

BI dashboards are included only to demonstrate downstream consumption

Insights and conclusions are entirely driven by the SQL layer

Scripts are designed to be adapted to Postgres, DuckDB, BigQuery, or similar engines

## 📌 Portfolio Note

This repository consolidates prior job-market SQL analysis designed for portfolio and professional review.
