📊 Labor Market Analytics: Data Jobs

SQL · Power BI · Workforce & Compensation Insights

Executive Summary

This project delivers an end-to-end labor market analysis of the data jobs ecosystem using 497K+ real-world job postings. The analysis focuses on compensation trends, role distribution, skill demand, and geographic concentration, transforming raw job data into decision-ready workforce insights. Check it out here ([sql_basics_project.ipynb]

Using SQL for data extraction and transformation and Power BI for interactive reporting, the project demonstrates how analytics teams can support hiring strategy, workforce planning, and market benchmarking without overengineering or black-box modeling.

Business Questions

This analysis was designed to answer practical, stakeholder-relevant questions such as:

Which data roles command the highest compensation?

How does pay vary by role type, location, and job category?

Where are data jobs geographically concentrated?

How do remote and location-based roles differ in salary structure?

What insights can inform hiring strategy and workforce planning?

Data Overview

Records: 497,000+ job postings

Domain: Data & Analytics labor market

Source: Public job-posting datasets

Key fields: Role title, salary, location, employment type

Salary data was standardized to enable consistent cross-role and geographic comparisons.

Methodology
1️⃣ Data Extraction & Transformation (SQL)

Queried and analyzed job-posting data using PostgreSQL

Applied:

Common Table Expressions (CTEs)

Complex joins

Aggregations and filters

Standardized salary formats (hourly vs annual)

Structured role categories for consistent analysis

2️⃣ Analytical Modeling (Power BI)

Imported cleaned SQL outputs into Power BI

Modeled relationships and measures using:

Power Query

DAX

Built calculated measures for:

Average salary

Job counts

Geographic comparisons

Role-level benchmarks

3️⃣ Visualization & Reporting (Power BI)

Developed an interactive dashboard including:

KPI summary cards

Clustered bar charts for role-based compensation

Line and area charts for salary trends

ArcGIS maps for geographic job concentration

Implemented slicers, bookmarks, and navigation for usability

Applied conditional formatting and visual hierarchy for clarity

Key Insights

Compensation is role-stratified: Specialized and senior data roles consistently command higher pay.

Geography matters: High-paying roles cluster in specific metro areas, though remote roles partially reduce geographic constraints.

Market structure outweighs titles: Role function and market demand explain compensation differences more than job naming conventions.

Remote vs on-site dynamics differ: Salary and demand patterns vary meaningfully between remote and location-based roles.

Dashboard Capabilities

The Power BI dashboard enables users to:

Compare salaries across roles and locations

Identify high-demand, high-paying data roles

Explore geographic concentration of job postings

Filter insights dynamically by role and region

(Representative dashboard screenshots are included in the repository.)
