## Business Questions

This analysis was designed to answer practical, stakeholder-relevant questions such as:

-  Which data roles command the highest compensation?

-  How does pay vary by role type and job category?

-  How do remote jobs compare to non-remote jobs?

-  How well does working in the data field pay without earning a degree?

## Key Insights

<img width="1920" height="1080" alt="DATA JOBS SALARY ADJUSTABLE 2 0" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4d9c8632-1d0e-49b4-ad64-39497221c577" />
<br><br>

-  **Top Paying roles:** The top paying roles are all Senior level roles with 4/5 roles being Data Scientist roles, with the exception in 4th place as a Data Engineering manager role. The salaries were ($475, $640, $850, $870 and $920) thousand in USD

  -  <img width="1920" height="1042" alt="JOB TITLE, ROLE, COMPANY, SALARY (TOP 10)" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/84f425e4-5b9d-4ad8-89bc-d36ba30f3be7" />
<br><br>
    

-  **Compensation is role-stratified:** Specialized and senior data roles consistently command higher pay.

-  **Geography matters:** High-paying roles cluster in specific metro areas, though remote roles partially reduce geographic constraints.

-  **Market structure outweighs titles:** Role function and market demand explain compensation differences more than job naming conventions.

-  **Skill distribution in regards to compensation:** Certain Niche or low supply skills have higher compensation.

-  **Remote vs on-site dynamics differ:** Salary and demand patterns vary meaningfully between remote and location-based roles. On-site roles also greatly outweigh postings or Remote roles

-  **Comparing remote VS non-remote compensation per skill for Data Analysts**
    -  The top and bottom 5 most profitable skills per job posting for remote jobs 

<img width="182" height="230" alt="Top and bottom 5 Average Salary per Skill" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1c79e8e8-d488-4038-92a2-4294bea75d88" />

<br>  

-  **Compared to**
    -  The top and bottom 5 most profitable skills per job posting for Non-remote jobs
 
  <img width="184" height="245" alt="NON REMOTE ANALYST 2 0" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a3eeaf46-604c-4918-bd3a-942ecffc630f" />

-  Both skill sets differ from the visuals shown and while there's a huge difference in the number of postings shown as remote vs non-remote, when we zone in using Data Analysts as an example,  the salary comparison for the highest and lowest postings among both classes are similar and although the non-remote posting has a top salary of $400,000, which is more than double that of the next salary for the non-remote posting at $179,000, and nearly double of the top role for the remote job at $208,000, we can conclude that basedon averages it is an outlier as even with different skill sets the rest of the salary ranges are much closer than the one outlier leads us to believe. 

<br><br> 

-  **The Job market can be rewarding without even earning a formal degree as shown below**

<br>

<img width="1316" height="744" alt="Top 10 Salaries" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/27483754-3678-4bd3-88b5-2515305ce6d7" />

<br> 

-  Accordingto the Visuals, Data Scientists show a much higher requirement in degree procurement as a hiring requirment in about 90% of the job postings in both senior and non-senior level positions recommending degrees for those in pursuit of Data science careers is therefore necessary for job safety. Data Engineers have a 50/50 split for both senior and non-senior postings. While senior postings may also focus less on degrees and more on skillset and previous experience, the non-senior roles show at the flip of a coin, Data Engineering positions may not require a degree as a pre-requisute for hiring. Data Analysts are a little more in favor of having a degree in the job posting requirement at about a 65% rate for both senior and non-senior positions as indicated by the job postings. All in all although both senior and non-senior postings across Data analysts, scientists and engineers show similar trends for levels of seniority in degree requirements, it doesn't take into consideration job roles, or number of years of experience.

<br><br>


## Recommendations (NOTE - These claims are hypotheses influenced by industry context as opposed to data driven conclusions)
<br>

-  Companies should consider more hybrid positions for Data facing roles at the very least or cater more job postings to be remote to potentially reduce employee stress and churn over time. With the onset of COVID, remote jobs sky rocketed especially for computer based roles such as most Data Jobs. However the visual [DEGREE, REMOTE AND JOB TYPES.PNG] found in [POWER_BI/DAX & QUERY VISUALS] on the main repo page at this link 🔗 [https://github.com/dareoyeleke/labor-market-analytics-data-jobs/blob/main/POWER_BI/DAX%20%26%20QUERY%20VISUALS%20/SALARY%20VS%20SKILL%20COUNT.png], shows a 13% demand of job postings are remote. While not included as part of this study, one can assume a higher preference of remote jobs for Data roles for the genera population.
 
  
-  Fostering career growth and matching compensation. Companies should endeavor to match the skill and experience level of Senior level roles with more compensation, as shown in the visual [POWER_BI/DAX & QUERY VISUALS/JOB TITLE, ROLE, COMPANY, SALARY (TOP 10).PNG] at this link 🔗 [https://github.com/dareoyeleke/labor-market-analytics-data-jobs/blob/main/POWER_BI/DAX%20%26%20QUERY%20VISUALS%20/JOB%20TITLE%2C%20ROLE%2C%20COMPANY%2C%20SALARY%20(TOP%2010).PNG] -  Context implies Senior positions are more experienced or skilled, and require more skill than the non-senior positions, the compensation doesn't match the demand.  For difference in job posting according to seniority, the differences are as such Data Analyst(97,519 at 86%), Data Scientists(75,933 at 77%) and Data Engineers(98,386 at 76%). With Median difference in compensation as such Data Analyst ($20,000 at 19%), Data Scientists($30,743 at 20%) and Data Engineers ($12,280 at 9%). There is a huge difference in postings between Senior positions and compensation, with 76% - 86% difference in position according to seniority, with 9% - 20% median difference in compensation.

<br><br>

## Limitations 

-  Specific Degree types were not present in the data set i.e (BS, MS, Doctorate)

-  Median Hourly adjusted income was calculated to 2080 hours per year, while yearly hours worked for yearly salaried roles were not present in the dataset

-  Degree requirements compared senior to non-senior positions without considering previous years of experience or specified Job Roles 





<br><br>
